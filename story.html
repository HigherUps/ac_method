    <p class="text">AC Method. The wonderful AC method. The amazing AC method has been injured in combat. We are not sure if he will make it. Doctors are franticly
      trying to save him, but the doctors aren't sure if he'll make it. Between the war of AC method and the quadratic formula, it looks like the quad formula has
      taken victory this time. But we can only hope that maybe, one day, AC method will rise again and finally defeat the stinky quadratic formula in the epic
      battles between AC method and the quad formula.</p>

    <p class="text">Doctors have finally treated AC method, he has survived. Now it is time for AC method to get revenge on the quad formula for what he has done 
      to him. AC method begins to plan his revenge on the quad formula. AC method will make sure that the quad formula will pay for what he has done. 
      AC method is thinking of ideas for revenge when he notices a shadow appear from the corner of his eye in his house. 
      AC method lives alone, so he knows that someone has broken into his house. AC method knows it must be the quad formula in his house, 
      so he runs to his closet, quietly opens the door, he has two weapons to choose from. '3x+8x+5=0' or '3(x)-1'. AC method knows that the quad formula
      would be able to solve the first one, so he grabs the second one. AC method runs out of the closet with '3(x)-1' in hand, he turns the corner and...</p>

    It wasn't the quad formula. It was something worse. <b>IT WAS FUCKING COMPLETING THE SQAURE! </b>Completing the square(cts) had broke into AC methods house and planned
      to attack him. This is something totally unexpected. CTS is 100x worse than the quad formula. Quickly, AC method throws 3(x)+1 at CTS -- S U P E R  E F F E C T I V E --
      Just kidding. Nothing happened. It literally did nothing. They are just numbers. CTS one taps AC method and once again, he has been injured in combat this time by CTS.

      Bad news. AC METHOD as been injured once again, and this time it is really bad. A new enemy has enetered the story. It's the midpoint. The midpoint has a 
      thing for attacking people in the middle of the body, including this time. AC METHOD has been hit in the middle of the chest, puncturing his left lung. This
      time he might not make it. The only possiblity that he can survive is if someone will donate a lung to him. Unfortuatly not many people want to dontate their
      lung to AC METHOD â€” Not many people like him. But thankfully someone was willing to donate their lung to AC METHOD. That person is...
